# Modern C++ Learning in Public

Welcome! 👋 This is my Learning in Public journey with C++ programming.

C++ is one of the most powerful and versatile programming languages out there. It's a 
general-purpose, multi-paradigm langauge, which means you can use it for:

-   **🎮 Game Development**
-   **🌐 Web servers**
-   **🖥️ Desktop applications**
-   **⚡ High-performance systems**
-   **🔌 Embedded systems**

What makes C++ special is the control it gives you: direct access to hardware, minimal abstraction, and the freedom to choose your programming style — procedural, object-oriented, or functional.

## What This Series Covers

I'll be sharing what i learn as i go, starting from basics and moving into advanced topics

**✅ The Basics**
-   **Setting up C++ on Windows, Linux**
-   **Variable and primitive types**
-   **Functions and loops**

**✅ Intermediate**
-   **Classes, inheritance and OOP concepts**
-   **Pointers and references**
-   **Desing patterns and practical use cases**

**✅ Advanced**
-   **Rule of Three & Rule of Five**
-   **Move semantics**
-   **Smart pointers and memory management**
-   **Allocators and performance tunning**

## Why Learning in Public?
-   **Keeps me accountable**
-   **Helps me solidify concepts by explaining them**
-   **Invites feedback and discussion from the community**
-   **Encourages continuous growth**

## Who Is This For?
-   **Beginners who know a bit of programming and want to dive into C++**
-   **Intermediate programmers curious about deeper topics like memory management**
-   **Anyone interested in building games, systems software, or performance-critical applications**
